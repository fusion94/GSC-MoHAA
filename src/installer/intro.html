<b>System Requirements</b>
<p>To use GSC MoHAA successfully, you need each of the following:

<ul>
<li>a Macintosh computer with OSX 10.3.9 or higher.
<li>a copy of Aspyr's Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, updated to the latest version.
<li>an installation of the "mohaa_server" unix command line tool.
<li>the Unix command line tool "unzip" must be in the folder "/usr/bin". On most OSX installations this is normally the case.
</ul>
<br>
<p>GSC MoHAA can be used on basically any Macintosh, but do note that running a game server is basically as heavy as playing the game itself. In it's memory, the Mac has to build a virtual 3D world in which all of the players run around. Each player also causes about 3 to 5 kb/s of data traffic on your network. If your processor or network is not fast enough, you may have to limit the number of players that can log on to your server.
